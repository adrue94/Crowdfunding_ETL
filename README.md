Repository for Project 2


This project was pretty straightforward for the both of us. I (Michael) worked on the Category, Subcategory and Contacts dataframes while Aldo tacked the campaign dataframe and Crowdfunding database. In the section labeled '# Read the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the `header=2` parameter when reading in the data.' I noticed that using the arguement '2' for the header only resulted in an error, but when I tried header=3 I was able to proceed with the expected outcome, so that is the value I used. This was noted within the comments of the code block.
