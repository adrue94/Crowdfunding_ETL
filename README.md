Repository for Project 2


This project was pretty straightforward for the both of us. I (Michael) worked on the Category, Subcategory and Contacts dataframes while Aldo tacked the campaign dataframe and Crowdfunding database. In the section labeled '# Read the data into a Pandas dataframe. Use the `header=2` parameter when reading in the data.' I noticed that using the arguement '2' for the header only resulted in an error, but when I tried header=3 I was able to proceed with the expected outcome, so that is the value I used. This was noted within the comments of the code block.    

A Drue:
This project had us manipulate load data into DataFrames, export them then load them into an SQL server. The manipulation of data via Pandas feels intuitive at this point, with QuickDBD it was possible to create the necessary scehma very quickly. All in all this mini-project felt smooth, with a lot of focus on refining and combining some of the materials we've learned up to this point.
There were some file conflict issues on Github that required a bit of wrangling to figure out, but otherwise no major issues.
